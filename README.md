# Robotics-2


Project 2 Navigation steps:
1) Build a URDF model of the robot scaled to the real one using RVIZ.
2) Implement collision and inertial components to allow for movement of the robot.
3) Add an RP Lidar scanner on top of the robot to allow for mapping.
4) Connect the computer to the raspberry Pi using the IP address of the microcontroller.
5) Connect the URDF model and RP Lidar to navigate first using keyboard commands as in assignment 1.
6) While the robot is being driven and the Lidar is scanning, launch slam toolbox to create a map of its surrounding and save it.
7) Add a map topic in RVIZ to locate the robot inside the newly saved map.
8) Launch navigation sequence and set a goalpost to drive the robot in the intended area.
